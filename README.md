# GNMF-CGG-WPE
This matlab code is an implementation of out recently proposed GNMF-CGG-WPE algorithm for speech dereverberation, and the corresponding paper is submitted to the IEEE/ACM TASLP. 

The dictionary "realRecordingData" contains the recorded and dereverberated speech signals, where reverberant speech signals are recoreded in a highly reverberant room with two glass walls, as shown in the following figure.
